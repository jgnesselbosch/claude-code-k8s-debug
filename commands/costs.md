# Cost Report

Show the user their token usage and estimated costs.

## Instructions

1. Use the ccusage MCP server to get today's usage report
2. Ask: "Can you show me today's usage from ccusage?"
3. Present the information clearly:
   - Total tokens used today
   - Estimated cost
   - Current session usage
   
4. If usage is high (>70% of typical daily quota), add a tip:
   "ðŸ’¡ Tip: Use `/clear` between debugging tasks to reduce context size"

Keep the response brief and actionable.
